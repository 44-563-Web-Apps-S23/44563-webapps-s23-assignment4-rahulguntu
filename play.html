        <h2> HYACINTH HALVEY _Lady Augusta Gregory_</h2>
            <h6 class="name">MRS.DELANE.</h6><p class="speech">There is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.
        </p>
        
            <h6 class="name">MR.QUIRKE.</h6>
            <p class="direction">[_Eagerly._]</p> 
            <p class="speech">Here is an antitreating button. I was made a
            present of it by one of my customers--I'll give it to you 
            <p class="direction">[_sticks it in_ HYACINTH'S _coat_]</p> 
            and welcome.
        </p>
       
            <h6 class="name">MRS.DELANE.</h6><p class="speech"> I suppose so. It's hard enough on myself to be down ready
for the mail-car in the morning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
often I haven't time to look who are the letters from--or the cards.
        </p>
        
        <h6 class="name">MR.QUIRKE.</h6> <p class="speech">It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
knocking about. If you did not have information of what is going on, who
should have it? Was it you, ma'am, was telling me that the new
sub-sanitary inspector would be arriving to-day?
        </p>
       
        <h6 class="name">MISS.JOYCE.</h6><p class="speech">If his reverence would mind me he would not quit the house
            to-night. He is no more fit to go speak at a meeting than 
            <p class="direction">[_pointing to the one hanging outside_ QUIRKE'S _door_]</p> 
        that sheep. To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that 
        train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.
        </p>
       
        <h6 class="name">MR.QUIRKE.</h6> <p class="speech">A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.
        </p>
        
        <h6 class="name">MRS.DELANE.</h6> <p class="speech">So she is; and there is the sergeant a little while after her.

        <p>
            MRS. DELANE. There is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.
        </p>
        <p>
            MR. QUIRKE. Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising? It
makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the night-time.
Going about the country, looking for little stags of sheep, striving to
knock a few shillings together. That contract for the soldiers gives me
a great deal to attend to.
        </p>
        <p>
            MRS. DELANE. I suppose so. It's hard enough on myself to be down ready
for the mail-car in the morning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
often I haven't time to look who are the letters from--or the cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            MR. QUIRKE. It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
knocking about. If you did not have information of what is going on, who
should have it? Was it you, ma'am, was telling me that the new
sub-sanitary inspector would be arriving to-day?
        </p>
        <p>
            MRS. DELANE. To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that
train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.
        </p>
        <p>
            MR. QUIRKE. A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.
        </p>
        <p>
            MRS. DELANE. So she is; and there is the sergeant a little while after
            her.
            
                 [_Enter_ MISS JOYCE.
